# Getting Started Guide

This is a test page with spaces in the filename.

The filename is `Getting Started Guide.mdx` but the URL should be `/docs/guides/getting-started-guide`.

## Features

- Spaces in filenames are supported
- URLs are automatically hyphenated
- Navigation shows the proper title from frontmatter

## Example

This demonstrates that you can organize your files with readable names that include spaces, and the system will automatically convert them to web-friendly hyphenated URLs.
